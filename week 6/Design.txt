Steps:
    1   load an api for marvel movies that haven't come out yet
    2   create a global array to store date and time of every marvel movie that is going to come out
    3   create a function that will repeat once every second
        a   create a variable to store current date and time
        b   calculate the difference between the two dates
        c   return nothing
    4   create a function to calculate difference between two dates and times
        a   find the difference in time
        b   find the difference between the dates
        c   store both in an array
        d   return the array
    5   create a function to figure out which marvel movie is next
        a   compare the current date against each marvel movie coming up
        b   return the one that is the closest without going over
    6   run the function from step 3
